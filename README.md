## Introduce

1. I come across a good idea that design a GUI which contain the basic functions when I use the network. 
2. I survey seven API companys, test their usability. Finally I choose three company and seven API. 
3. In order to reduce learning cost, I decide to use tkinter package rather than PyQT.
4. The GUI just a software which is integrated by various API.
