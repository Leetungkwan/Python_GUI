## Introduce the Tkinter

Tkinter is a GUI library for Python that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating desktop applications with graphical user interfaces. It comes with Python and is cross-platform, but has limited theming and customization options compared to other GUI frameworks

## Features

- Tkinter allows developers to create windows, dialogs, buttons, text boxes, labels, and other GUI components using Python code. It also provides layout managers that help developers arrange components in a user-friendly way. Tkinter has a wide range of widgets to choose from, including menus, scrollbars, listboxes, radio buttons, check buttons, and more.
- One of the advantages of Tkinter is that it comes with Python, so there is no need to install any additional libraries or tools. It is also cross-platform and works on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Tkinter's main disadvantage is that it has limited theming and customization options, which can make it difficult to create visually appealing applications.

## Idea

1. I come across a good idea that design a GUI which contain the basic functions when I use the network.
2. I survey seven API companys, test their feasibility. Finally I choose three company and seven API.
3. In order to reduce learning cost, I decide to use Tkinter package rather than PyQT.
4. The GUI just a software which is integrated by various API.
